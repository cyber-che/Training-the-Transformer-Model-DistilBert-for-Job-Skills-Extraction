Baseline (Current)-Mandy Stats original
Iteration 1: Train model (3 epochs) with 1000, 500 and 100 skill limit and compare their metrics. Pick most promising then explain why.
Iteration 2: (Compare results for different number of epochs, 3,5,10,15) see effects on stats (plot epoch num with validation accuracy). Try to avoid overfitting (a good sign is when training accuracy continues to increase but validation accuracy stagnates or even decreases)
Iteration 3: 
Iteration 4:
Iteration 5:
